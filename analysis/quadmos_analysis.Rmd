Preliminaries.

```{r prelims}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(binom)
library(lme4)
library(bootstrap)
library(magrittr)
library(stringr)

## for bootstrapping 95% confidence intervals
theta <- function(x,xdata,na.rm=T) {mean(xdata[x],na.rm=na.rm)}
ci.low <- function(x,na.rm=T) {
  mean(x,na.rm=na.rm) - quantile(bootstrap(1:length(x),1000,theta,x,na.rm=na.rm)$thetastar,.025,na.rm=na.rm)}
ci.high <- function(x,na.rm=T) {
  quantile(bootstrap(1:length(x),1000,theta,x,na.rm=na.rm)$thetastar,.975,na.rm=na.rm) - mean(x,na.rm=na.rm)}

Load data.

```{r data_clean}
d1 <- read.csv("../data/experiment_1.tsv", header=TRUE, 
              sep="\t", row.names=NULL, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
d2 <- read.csv("../data/experiment_2.tsv", header=TRUE, 
               sep="\t", row.names=NULL, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

rd <- bind_rows(d1, d2)
```

Constants:

* Are all squares parallelograms?
* Are all squares rectangles?

```{r}
questions <- c("sr","sh","sp","rs","rh","rp","hs","hr","hp","ps","pr","ph")

correct_answers <- c(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) 
answer_key <- 1 - correct_answers ## a yes answer is coded as "0" in the data

related <- list(square = which(grepl("s", questions)),
                rectangle = which(grepl("r", questions)),
                rhombus = which(grepl("h", questions)),
                parallel = which(grepl("p", questions)))

```

Data cleaning
-------------

* shape numbers: 0 square, 1 rectangle, 2 rhombus, 3 parallelogram
* conditions: 3 Active learning, 4 Passive learning, 5 Baseline condition

d <- rd %>% 
  select(workerid, starts_with("Answer")) %>%
  rename(pre = Answer.pretest_responses_by_presented_order,
         post = Answer.posttest_responses_by_presented_order,
         ord = Answer.permutations_used,
         time = Answer.training_time, 
         shape = Answer.shape_of_focus,

                # note zero indexing of orders, that's why +1

  gather(phase, resp, pre, post) %>%
  mutate(cond = factor(cond, 
                       levels = c(3,4,5), 
                       labels = c("active", "teaching", "baseline")),
         shape = factor(shape, 
                        levels = c(0, 1, 2, 3), 
                        labels = c("square","rectangle","rhombus","parallel")),

```

Analysis
--------

Between subjects

```{r}
ms <- d %>% 
  group_by(cond, shape, phase, question, relevant) %>%
  summarise(m.cih = ci.high(correct),
            m.cil = ci.low(correct),            
            m = mean(correct))

qplot(question, m, fill = phase, 
      ymin = m - m.cil, ymax = m + m.cih,
      position = position_dodge(width = .9),
      alpha = relevant, 
      facets = shape ~ cond, 
      data = ms,       
      geom = c("bar", "linerange"), stat = "identity") 
```

Within subjects change scores

```{r}
ms <- d %>% 
  select(-resp) %>% 
  spread(phase, correct) %>%  
  group_by(cond, shape, question, relevant) %>%
  summarise(m.cih = ci.high(post - pre),
            m.cil = ci.low(post - pre),            
            m = mean(post - pre))

qplot(question, m, fill = relevant,
      ymin = m - m.cil, ymax = m + m.cih,
      position = position_dodge(width = .9),
      facets = shape ~ cond, 
      data = ms,       
      geom = c("bar", "linerange"), stat = "identity") 
```

Within subjects but aggregated across questions

```{r}
ms <- d %>% 
  select(-resp) %>% 
  spread(phase, correct) %>%  
  group_by(workerid, cond, shape, relevant) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(post - pre)) %>%
  group_by(cond, shape, relevant) %>%
  summarise(m.cih = ci.high(m),
            m.cil = ci.low(m),
            m = mean(m), 
            n = n())

qplot(cond, m, fill = relevant,
      ymin = m - m.cil, ymax = m + m.cih,
      position = position_dodge(width = .9),
      facets = . ~ shape, 
      data = ms,       
      geom = c("bar", "linerange"), stat = "identity")
```

Basic analysis over all questions - pretest only. Sanity check that we are getting reasonable answers?

```{r}
ms <- d %>% 
  filter(phase == "pre") %>%
  group_by(workerid, question) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(1 - resp)) %>%
  group_by(question) %>%
  summarise(m.cih = ci.high(m),
            m.cil = ci.low(m),
            m = mean(m))

qplot(question, m, 
      ymin = m - m.cil, ymax = m + m.cih,
      position = position_dodge(width = .9),
      data = ms,       
      geom = c("bar", "linerange"), stat = "identity") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, lty = 2)
