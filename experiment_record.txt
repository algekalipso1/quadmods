Notes: In passive learning condition for rombhuses participants learned better what a rhombus is than in the active learning condition.




Experiment 2 - May 11th 2015
Purpose: To generalize the previous experiment to the other two "non-trivial" shapes (rectangles and parallelograms).

Reward: 0.25
Participants: 120 (an expected of 30 on each condition).

var all_answers_provided = 0;
var questions_permuted = 1;
var skip_check = 0;
var training_regime = random(3, 4);
var examples_to_show = 3;
var to_choose_from = [1, 3];
var shape_of_focus = choose_from(to_choose_from);

Experiment 3 - June 1st 2015 
The main idea here is to simply add samples to the two previous experiments. Take care of the baseline condition after this.


Reward: 0.25
Participants: 180


var all_answers_provided = 0;
var questions_permuted = 1;
var skip_check = 0;
var training_regime = random(3, 4);
var examples_to_show = 3;
var to_choose_from = [1, 2, 3];
var shape_of_focus = choose_from(to_choose_from);


Assignments completed: 180/180 (100%)
         Time elapsed: 8:09:41 (h:mm:ss)
  Average submit time: 179.8 seconds
